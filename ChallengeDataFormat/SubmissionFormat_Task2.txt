# Team name: CMRchellenger#1 (replace it with your team name)
# you can write down anything here that you hope to let us know!

# name your results with the same name as the original data name!
# Task 1 and Task 2 can be submitted separately or together! They will be separately assessed.
# For testing phase, change the name of "ValidationSet" to "TestSet"! Keep other the same!

# During validation phase
% to reduce the computing burden and space, we only evaluate the central 2 slices
% For cine: use the first 3 time frames for ranking!
% For mapping: we need all weighting for ranking!
% crop the middle 1/6 of the original image for ranking

# You can use the function we provided to help you to convert your data for ranking. 
# You don't need to perform reduction during test phase!!!

function img4ranking = run4Ranking(img)

[sx,sy,~,sz,~] = size(img);
reconImg = img(:,:,round(sz/2)-1:round(sz/2),1:3);
img4ranking = single(crop(abs(reconImg),[round(sx/3),round(sy/2),2,3]));

return
% img: complex images reconstructed with the dimensions (sx,sy,sz,t/w) in
% original size
% -sx: matrix size in x-axis
% -sy: matrix size in y-axis
% -sz: slice number (short axis view); slice group (long axis view)
% -t/w: time frame/weighting

% img4ranking: "single" format images with the dimensions (sx/3,sy/2,2,3)
% -sx/3: 1/3 of the matrix size in x-axis
% -sy/2: half of the matrix size in y-axis
% img4ranking is the data we used for ranking!!!

The file names should match the original data names with data dimensions consistent with the original data (excluding the coil dimension). For instance, if you have reconstructed data located at "MultiCoil/Mapping/ValidationSet/AccFactor10/P001/T1map.mat", you should use 'img4ranking' as the key when saving the reconstructed data.
